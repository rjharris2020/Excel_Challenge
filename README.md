# Excel_Challenge
 My Excel Kickstart assignment used to challenge and display my skills using Excel. Some of the skills I used with assignment include:
 1. Creating tables and sorting data
 2. Conditional formatting
 3. Charts and graphs such as stacked, line, scatter, etc.
 4. Pivot charts
 5. Pivot tables
 
## About this assignment:
Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

### What type of questions am I trying to answer based on my analysis?
1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
2. What are some limitations of this dataset?
3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

### Bonus Statistical Analysis
1. Can I create a line chart that graphs the relationship between a goal's amount and its chances at success, failure, or cancellation?
2. Evaluate the number of backers of successful and unsuccessful campaigns by creating your a summary statistics table.

Charts and conclusions can be found in the StartedBook_RJH.xlsx and Kickstart My Chart Conclusion.docx files.
